/**
 * <pre>
 * Module: Privilege Management
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * Title: Privilege Management (Basics)
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Goal:
 * Learn about the retrieving privileges in {@link javax.jcr.security.AccessControlManager)
 * and the API defined by the {@link org.apache.jackrabbit.api.security.authorization.PrivilegeManager}
 * API extension.
 *
 * Exercises:
 *
 * - {@link #testGetPrivilege()}
 *   Use this exercise to become familiar with the different ways to retrieve
 *   a privilege.
 *
 * - {@link #testGetSupportedAndRegisteredPrivileges()}
 *   Learn about the difference between supported and registered privileges.
 *   Based on the API contract compare the results of the 2 methods in the current
 *   implementation and discuss different ways of implementation.
 *
 *
 * Related Exercises:
